# Extension

## Core Mechanism


The extension mechanism would be additional data fields that the individual card holders or the card hold itself can hold.
That way when new tasks need to be done; the data field will act as the base of it.

### Send to any individual on the whole UW campus

1. Send a request for the indivudal by creating a unique identifer for the card that says who it's looking for
2. A unique field that states whether or not the person has recived the card
3. Pass around the card and change the field to say that the person has recived the card
   until it reaches the person that it's looking. 


### Specify whether contents are ASCII text, Unicode text, or binary values

1. Create a data field on the card that says what type of data the contents of the card is
2. End points will be able to read the contents on the ASCII text


### Keep a record of what nodes the card has passed through.

1. Create a list data field in the card
2. Add the node that the card travels to into a list
3. Any point can read the list
